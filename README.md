# Geozzle

*Geozzle* is a geography quizz using requests to WikiData to gather all available clues for different countries. Players can choose the continent they want to play and attempt to guess all countries within it using as few clues as possible. The objective of the game is simple: collect all countries of each continent.


This game was developped as a school project for the *Connaissances et Raisonnement* class at CentraleSup√©lec.

## Installation

### Cloning the repository

To clone the github repository, you have to search the clone button on the main page of the project. Then click on it and select `https` or `ssh` depending on your favorite mode of connexion. Copy the given id and then open a terminal on your computer, go to the folder where you want to install the project and use the following command:

```bash
git clone <your copied content>
```

### Creation of a virtual environment

You might want to use a virtual environment to execute the code. To do so, use the following command:

```bash
python -m virtualenv venv
```

To start it, use the command on *Windows*:

```bash
./venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1
```

Or for *MacOS* and *Linux*:

```bash
source venv/Scripts/activate
```

### Installation of the necessary librairies

To execute this software, you need several *Python* librairies, specified in the `requirements.txt` file. To install them, use the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Launch the code

The main code can be launched by running the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Utilization

        <td align="justify">A tutorial has been written inside the game and when the user launches the game for the first time, the tutorial is displayed. The user can also see it again by clicking on the information button on the bottom-left hand corner of the home screen. 
        The default language is English, but if the player prefers to play in French, they can switch the game language by clicking on the flag button in the top-right corner of the home screen.</td>

## Architecture of the project

The project is divided into several folders:

- `licenses`, containing the different licenses used in this project.
- `resources`, containing the following folders:
  - `fonts`, containing the fonts of the application.
  - `images`, containing all the images used in the application.
  - `languages`, containing the dictionaries of language.
  - `manifest`, containing some tools for the Play Store.
  - `musics`, containing the musics of the game.
  - `queries`, containing some results of the queries to Wikidata. It also contains the module `convert_geojson_to_png.py`, which converted the geojson data into images of the shape of the countries.
  - `sounds`, containing the sound effects of the game.
- `screens`, containing the *Python* modules for the different screens. The subfolder `custom_widgets` contains tools widgets inserted in the screens.
- `tools`, divided into several subfolders and modules:
  - `basic_tools`, folder containing basis tools.
  - `game_tools`, folder containing tools for sounds.
  - `kivy_tools`, folder used for general *Kivy* widgets and functions.
  - `constants.py`, module containing the constants of the application.
  - `geozzle.py`, module containing the main class of the logic of the application.
  - `kivyads.py`, module containing the tools to add ads in the application.
  - `kivyreview.py`, module containig the tools to display the in app review of the game.
  - `path.py`, module containing the constants for the paths.
  - `sparql.py`, module containing the different requests to Wikidata.

It also contains the following files:

- `data.json`, *json* file where are stored the data of the user.
- `.gitignore`
- `main.kv`, *Kivy* module associated to `main.py`.
- `main.py`, main *Python* module of the application.
- `requirements.txt`, list of packages required to run the app.

## Requests to *Wikidata*

All our requests are implemented in python in the `tools/sparql.py` file. Their results are stored in `resources/queries`. We used to main request on Wikidata for this game :

- a request to get all countries of each continent
- a request to get all available clues of a country

### Request to get all countries of each continent 

This request is implemented in the `request_countries_continent` function. The results are store in `resources/queries/continents` in the form of JSON files. We created two files for each continent : one for French and one for English. Each file is a dictionary containing the Wikidata code and name of each country.

This request is created as follow : for a continent, we gather every countries and states, then remove any instance of 'fictional country', 'fictional state', 'historical country', 'disputed country', or any of their subclasses. This allowed us to have the the cleanest list of countries with minimal post-processing required.

For our post-processing, we created the `resources/queries/continents/exceptions.json` file. It contains two dictionaries: one for countries to remove (to_remove), which includes the codes of countries to be excluded for each continent, and another for countries to add (to_add), which lists additional codes and country names to include in our JSON files. 

For example, China and Taiwan were excluded in our initial request as they are both disputed countries. We manually added them during the post-processing.

This `exceptions.json`in used in the `request_countries_continent` function to adjust the lists of countries accordingly.

These JSON files are generated ahead of gaming. You can recreated them by running the sparql.py file, specifying the language argument as either French ('fr') or English ('en').

### Request to get all available clues of a country

This request is employed during gameplay, leading to a short loading time when switching countries. However, it ensures that the clues offered are current and accurate, which was the primary motivation behind its creation.
